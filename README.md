# Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Analytics
MIE1624 â€“ Fall 2018, University of Toronto

The objective of the course is to learn analytical models and overview quantitative algorithms for solving engineering and business problems. Data science or analytics is the process of deriving
insights from data in order to make optimal decisions. It allows hundreds of companies and governments to save lives, increase profits and minimize resource usage. Considerable attention in the course is devoted to
applications of computational and modeling algorithms to finance, risk management, marketing, health care, smart city projects, crime prevention, predictive maintenance, web and social media analytics, personal
analytics, etc. We will show how various data science and analytics techniques such as basic statistics, regressions, uncertainty modeling, simulation and optimization modeling, data mining and machine learning,
text analytics, artificial intelligence and visualizations can be implemented and applied using Python. Python and IBM Watson Analytics are modeling and visualization software used in this course. Practical aspects of
computational models and case studies in Interactive Python are emphasized.

There are two assignments which are 'Sentiment_Analysis' and 'Salary_Prediction', a classification and a regression problem.
