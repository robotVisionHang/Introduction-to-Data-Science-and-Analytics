# Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Analytics
MIE1624 â€“ Fall 2018, University of Toronto

The objective of the course is to learn analytical models and overview quantitative algorithms for solving engineering and business problems. Considerable attention in the course is devoted to applications of computational and modeling algorithms to finance, risk management, marketing, health care, smart city projects, crime prevention, predictive maintenance, web and social media analytics, personal analytics, etc. We will show how various data science and analytics techniques such as basic statistics, regressions, uncertainty modeling, simulation and optimization modeling, data mining and machine learning, text analytics, artificial intelligence and visualizations can be implemented and applied using Python.

There are two assignments which are 'Sentiment_Analysis' and 'Salary_Prediction', a classification and a regression problem.
