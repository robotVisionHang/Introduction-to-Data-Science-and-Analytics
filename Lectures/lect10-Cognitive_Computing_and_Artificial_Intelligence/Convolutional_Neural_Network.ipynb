    "### Building a Convolutional Neural Network \n",
    "This notebook is a brief guide to using TensorFlow's layers modules to build a convolutional neural network \n",
    "model to recognize the handwritten digits in the MNIST data set, which contains 60,000 training \n",
    "examples and 10,000 test examples of the handwritten digits 0–9, stored as 28x28-pixel black-and-white images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers module provides methods that facilitate the creation of convolutional neural networks with fully \n",
    "connected layers and convolutional layers, adding activation functions, and applying dropout regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an architecture for image classification tasks consisting of a series \n",
    "of filters that are applied to images represented as pixel vectors to extract (and learn) higher-level features, \n",
    "which can later be used for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN contains three components:\n",
    " - Convolutional layers, each of which applies a specified convolution filter to the image. Each layer encodes subregions of the image as a single value to be stored in the output feature map.\n",
    "- Pooling layers, which reduce the dimensionality of the feature map by using non-linear functions (e.g., max-pooling, average-pooling, etc.). Max pooling partitions the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles (e.g., 2x2-pixel regions) and, for each such rectangle, outputs the maximum, thus reducing the spatial size of the representation and hence the amount of computation needed in the network. This also helps control overfitting. Pooling layers are commonly inserted between successive convolutional layers.\n",
    "- Fully-connected layers (where every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer), which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CNN is composed of a stack of modules where each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer, together performing feature extraction. The last convolutional module is linked to one or more fully-connected (i.e., dense) layers that perform classification. The last dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each of the possible classes the model may predict, with a softmax activation function to generate a value between 0–1 for each node.  The softmax values for a given image are interpreted as a measure of how likely it is that the image belongs to each of the possible classes. (The sum of all the softmax values is equal to 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary modules."
